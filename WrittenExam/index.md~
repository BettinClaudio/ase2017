# Written Exam

The written exam can be taken in alternative to the project.

The exam is in the form of both open and closed questions. Questions might include the following
topics:

* Ruby programming, with questions such as those proposed in the first assignment (e.g., write
  a function which converts a decimal number into the Roman notation)
* Rails programming, with questions typically (but not necessarily) related to scaffold generation
  (e.g., given an ER diagram, write the scaffolding commands to implement the data)
