# Written Exam

The written exam can be taken in alternative to the project.  The project can
be taken also when the course is not running, by arranging a special agreement
with the teachers.

The exam is in the form of both open and closed questions. It is open-book: you
can consult books and notes during the exam.

Questions might include the following topics:

* Ruby programming, with questions such as those proposed in the first
  assignment (e.g., write a function which converts a decimal number into the
  Roman notation)
* Rails programming, with questions typically (but not necessarily) related to:
  - scaffold generation (e.g., write the scaffolding commands to implement the
    data represented by a given ER diagram)
  - migrations (e.g, write a migration to implement the transition from an
    existing data model to a given target data model)
* Writing Scenarios in Cucumber 
  - given a standard Rails application implementing a diven data model, write
    the scenarios testing the "new" and "update" functions
  - given a user story, write the scenarios testing the implementation of the
    user story in a standard Rails app
* Writing specifications with rspec
* Agile Planning, with questions such as:
  - given a list of user stories, allocate them to the sprints
  - given a burndown chart, compute the velocity of the team
  
Given the nature of the exam, we expect the programming exercises to be
written and tested on a computer and delivered in electronic format, via a
push to Github.

**We strongly advise students to come with their own devices with a working
Ruby on Rails environment and a working copy of Git (see the instructions of
the assignment for the details).**

Please let us know if you do not have a laptop and need to get a device from
us.
  
For the reference material to prepare for the exam, have a look at the
Syllabus, which lists some good resources.  Not all chapters of all books are
necessary to pass the exam; reading all the material, in any case, shouldn't
cause any permanent brain damage.

If you are fond of Ruby, you might also want to
consider [Programming in Ruby](http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/)
or any of the other books and resources listed
on [Ruby Documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/) page.
